Academical 3.0 is rendition of the experimental research game *Academical*, originally made using Twine. Academical is an educational game that teaches players about the Responsible Conduct of Research and ethics. In this version, players must do their best to resolve scenarios that place ethical decision making in conflict with navigating social relationships. The design is meant to showcase how ethical decision-making is more difficult when you factor in the social realities realities of the workplace (friendships, power imbalances, personal goals, etc.).
