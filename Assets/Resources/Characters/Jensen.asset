  bio: 'You don''t know Jensen very well, but you''ve noticed them hanging out around
    the department more and more often recently. They particularly follow Ivy around
    closely, tagging into meetings and asking questions incessantly. You know they
    are an undergraduate student hustling to land a PhD, but you haven''t heard much
    about their contributions to any given project. You''ve listened to unsubstantiated
    whispers here and there about some strange connections Jensen has with the faculty.
    Regardless of their experience or history, it''s nice to see someone with bright
    eyes and ambition around the department, even if it brings a little naivete with
    it. '
