  bio: "You play as Bronislav, an international PhD student that is studying Developmental
    Psychology under Dr. Hendricks. You are fairly advanced in your degree and are
    trying to finish up your last round of studies before you author your dissertation.
    The pressure is on! Your success this term and at upcoming conferences will help
    determine if you get your dream position (and extend your Visa to stay near your
    friends). \n\nYou have good friends in Brad and frequently ask Dr. Ned Smith
    (he insists you call him Ned) for guidance. Dr. Ivy Li is well-known and intimidates
    you somewhat. There are several younger students joining your lab, and everyone
    in the department is somewhat frazzled as they prepare for their upcoming research
    and publications."
