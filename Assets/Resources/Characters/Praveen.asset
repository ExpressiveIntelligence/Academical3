  bio: Praveen, a young PhD student in the department, is trying to build out his
    network and research strategy. Like most early graduate students, he strikes
    a balance between natural intellectual talent and eagerness, but struggles with
    focus and managing his projects. He is currently trying to figure out where he
    "belongs" in his field, and is trying to build professional relationships with
    different departments and research organizations by volunteering where ever he
    can. He's spinning a few paper and research projects right now, but is having
    trouble nailing down what exactly he wants to say through them. You generally
    are on good terms with Praveen, but you don't really go out of your way to hang
    out with him.
