  bio: 'Brad is a good friend of yours. He is studying under Ned and is also in the
    Psychology Department, where he is working with you on an exciting study that
    will significantly enhance both of your CVs. He is bright, friendly, and wants
    the best for those around him. That being said, he can also be a bit hasty and
    rash, sometimes tripping over himself or oversharing while pursuing his following
    goals and socializing with others. These tendencies can sometimes leave him in
    sticky situations and hurt others, but he is quick to rectify his mistakes with
    a bit of help, awareness, and guidance. He is skeptical about the new students
    coming into the department. '
