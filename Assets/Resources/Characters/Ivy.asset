  bio: Dr. Ivy Li is an all-star in both the department as well as the field of Psychology
    overall. She has more publications than you can count, and even more citations
    from other academics. She was made a tenured professor very quickly, and has
    an uncanny ability to land grants and partnerships with large companies with
    ease. She is brilliant, well-connected, and quite frankly, a bit intimidating.
    Getting on her good side can get you set up with amazing opportunities, but getting
    on her bad side... Well, you really don't want to be on her bad side.
