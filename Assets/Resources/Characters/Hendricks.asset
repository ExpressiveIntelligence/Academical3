  bio: 'Dr. Matilda Hendricks (who just goes by Hendricks, as she dislikes her first
    name) is your advisor. She is a newly minted associate professor, but has not
    yet been tenured. She is quick-witted, hard-working, and understanding. You are
    grateful to have such a wise and caring mentor, and generally feel like you can
    share anything in confidence with her. That being said, it''s been a bit hard
    to get time with her lately - she''s been taking on more and more commitments
    over the last year as she seeks to bolster her record for a potential tenure
    position. She''s currently feeling frazzled over an upcoming conference that
    she''s chairing. You can tell she worries about letting anything drop, but she
    always manages to keep everything together and deliver according to expectations. '
