  bio: 'Dr. Ned Smith is a brilliant, easy-going, and kind professor in your department.
    While he isn''t your direct advisor, you have taken many of his classes and collaborate
    with him on many projects. He directly advises Brad, and the three of you have
    gotten coffee on many occasions. Despite his relaxed demeanor, Ned is serious
    about his work and operates by the book. He is known in the department for his
    clean, well-documented studies and data, alongside a history of successful students.
    He is passionate about his work and always excited for the next discovery. He
    dislikes being addressed as "Dr. Smith". '
