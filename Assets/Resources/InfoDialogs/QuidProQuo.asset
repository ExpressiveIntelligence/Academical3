  title: What is a quid pro quo?
  slides:
  - text: 'A "quid pro quo" is used to describe situations where people exchange
      goods or services, but the exchange is contigent on one party perforing their
      potion of the exchange first.


      Often quid pro quos situations should
      be avoided as they blah blah blah bad stuff.'
