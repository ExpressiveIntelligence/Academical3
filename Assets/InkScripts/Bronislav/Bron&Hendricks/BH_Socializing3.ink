* [Cancel meeting] 
 You think about cancelling, but remember that it's been a while since you've updated her on any of your progress. Evenmoreso maybe you should get a second opinion on Ivy's offer?

You enter Hendricks' office, eyeing a meticulously organized stack of books next to her. The largest of the books lies open on the table in front of her, and she is lost in thought.

        Bronislav: "It seems like a fair deal. Jensen gets the credit he needs for grad school and I get a sponsor for my visa."
        
        Hendricks: "I don't know if you should be so comfortable with this arrangement, Bronislav. I don't think its ethical to trade favors like this in an academic context."

        Bronislav: "It feels wrong, right? Ivy has been really focused on the fact that I need someone to sponsor my visa, and it has really been stressing me out. I know I could really use what she's offering, but I am not sure that its the right thing to do."
        
        Hendricks: "I think you are right. It feels like a breach of ethics to me that Ivy even put you in such a position."

Hendricks: "It brings bias into your work that undermines its integrity. What Ivy is offering sounds like "quid pro quo", which is essentially trading one favor for another. Its a slippery slope of conflicting interests.

    She nods in appreciation.
