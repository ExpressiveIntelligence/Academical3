Hendricks Socializing 4
=======================

Location: Hendrick's Office
Day: 4
Is Required: No

In this optional scene, the player (Bronislav) expresses to their advisor,
Hendricks that they are not worried about adding Jensen to the paper. This
scene is intended to check if players understand the ethical reasons why
gift authorship is problematic.

This scene contains a moderate amount of exposition. Players can skip past
it if they already know about it, but they will need to demonstrate that to
Hendricks first. If they both explain it AND do the wrong thing, they are
DOUBLE in the wrong and will lose major opinion points with Hendricks.

Personal Notes
==============

- State the starting point(s) and their conditions.
- State the storytelling goal(s).
- State the potential ending points, their conditions, and their effects.
- State any mechanics the player navigates in the scene. For example,
  this scene is designed to be a tense interaction between Bron and
  Hendricks. So, they have choice options to raise and lower the tension
  between the characters.
- Writing in spread sheets limits the dynamism of the initial text because
  its hard to represent things like the joke dice roll above
