She raises an eyebrow and tries to hide laugh.

Hendricks: "Yes I'm fine thank you."

She says through a small laugh.

Bronislav: "Besides, but I think I have a pretty good judge of character. Like Praveen."

Hendricks silently looks at you with her "non-judgemental" stare.

=== BHS1_ISaidIWasUnsure ===
Bronislav: "Exactly why I said I was unsure about it. Jensen's got promise, but maybe needs something more his speed."

Hendricks: "You could say that again. Glad to hear everything's going well Bronislav, I've got to head out but I hope we can meet again soon."

She gets up from the table and leaves, waving at one of her students on the way out.

You prepare to say this but hold back. Hendricks knows Praveen's been struggling since he's arrived. Even though you have hopes for him, you probably should be truthful about what's actually happening. ->BHS1_TrapDoorPraveen

Bronislav: "Sure, he may be struggling a bit, but that's just kind of how the first year goes."

Hendricks: "You're right. Well I'd have to wish you the best of luck on your endeavour Bronislav. If you need some more helpful advice on your paper you can always reach out."
