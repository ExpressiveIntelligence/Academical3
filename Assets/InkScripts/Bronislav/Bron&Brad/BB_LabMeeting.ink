Bronislav: "That's all you're doing?"

Brad seems offended.

Brad: "No Bronislav, I obviously do more, just nothing I thought would interest you. Like right now I'm spending my time to see how people I knew were working on papers, like you, were doing."

Brad: "I just wanted to talk, smooth things out. You know? It's alright if you don't want to Bronislav, I've got other people to talk to anyways."

Brad: "Well..." 

Brad: "If you're free later I'd love to talk a bit more. I'm going to head out to the cafe.
