Bronislav: "You withdrew the paper, right Brad?"

Brad sarcastically rolls his eyes.

Brad: "Well good to see you too." 

Brad: "But yes, I did! It was, not an easy conversation to have with Ned, but he and I both realized that it was our best option. No hassle with the IRB, and everything is still in tact."

Bronislav: "You withdrew the paper, right Brad?"

Brad struggles to speak for a moment.

BradL "I... I didn't withdraw the paper Bronislav. Somehow the IRB found out and the paper has been rejected. Ned is furious with me, and now I've got ethics trainings I've got to go to."
