Ivy: "I've got to head out now, glad we could do a little check in. Just make sure this stays between us three, and everything will go smoothly."

=== BI_Socializing5_AnyNewNews ===
Bronislav: "Of course, is there any new news?"

Ivy thinks for a second.

Ivy: "Well, no. Since you were a bit indecisive I held off of telling my uncle, but now that things are set in stone I for sure can now."


Ivy: "I know it was all spur of the moment, but I just wanted to make sure that Jensen would be able to secure this opportunity."

She rolls her eyes.

Ivy: "It's not that big of a deal. Just keep it between us and everything will go smoothly. Everyone gets what they wanted right?"

She packs up her bag, "Well, I've got to run. I'm excited to see how the paper will go, I'll talk to you later Bronislav."

Ivy lets out a grunt at you saying this.

Ivy: "Not great.. not great. I've had to start finding our backup plan for Jensen, my class just had to submit a project, so I'm definitely a bit overwhelmed."

You sit down at the table silently, and this clearly irks Ivy. 

She half-heartedly smiles.

Ivy: "I know. He's just really struggling to get into grad school, and that's always been a dream for him. It'd be so sad to see him make it this far and not get in."

Bronislav: "It's not happening Ivy, and that's final. Jensen is not getting my help, no matter how many times you ask or dangle a job in front of me."

Ivy: "Fine Bronislav, have it your way. We'll both get out of your hair and figure something else out. Thanks a ton." 

She glares at you, fuming.

Ivy: "I've got to go. Bye."

She quickly storms out of the cafe, slamming the door catching the attention of everyone.

She looks at you confused. 

Ivy: "Do you think I haven't considered that? Of course I've thought about that, and I still did it.

She takes a deep breath, controlling her temper. 

Ivy: "Whatever Bronislav. I'm leaving. Bye."

She scoffs. 

Ivy: "Yet you still accepted at one point, so you understood where I was coming from then. It's sad to see Jensen learn nothing from all of this, I thought you'd be a good mentor. But I guess I expected too much from you."
