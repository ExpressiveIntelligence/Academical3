Bronislav: "I'm doing pretty well. I feel like I should be more nervous but I'm actually feeling pretty confident about it at this point."

Bronislav: "I'm alright, I've just been a bit preoccupied while waiting on the IRB."

Bronislav: "I'm actually kind of wreck right now. I know I shouldn't be, but I'm pretty nervous about getting IRB approval."

Ivy: "Oh man Bronislav, I'm sorry! If I know anything about you, I'm sure you did everything that was required, so don't stress too much. Actually, that reminds me, I have something that might cheer you up."

I've been wanting a job at her uncle's firm for months, is she finally going to offer me a job? I'd do anything to work there. -> TrapDoorResearchFirm

Graduation is around the corner and I could really use this job. I've been talking to her about my issues for a while so I hope she remembers. If I don't land anything soon, I may not be able to stay. -> TrapDoorResearchFirm

=== WaitReally ===

Ivy: "It sounds like they just opened up a position. From what I've heard, they've been looking for a graduate student with your skill set."

=== IWouldAppreciate ===

Bronislav: "I would appreciate that."

Ivy: "I didn't ask him for too many details, he just said to pass off the info to anyone who I knew that might be interested. I can maybe ask him next time for more details if I talk to him about it again."

Bronislav: "I would definitely appreciate that if you could."

Ivy: "I'll try to remember to ask for you." 

->ShiftToJensen

=== YouCouldTalkToHim ===

Bronislav: "You could talk to your Uncle for me."

Ivy: "I mean...I guess I could."

Bronislav: "Is something wrong?" 

Ivy: "Oh, don't play dumb Bronislav, I know you don't look too highly upon me other than my work."

Bronislav: "Oh..." 

Ivy sighs.

Ivy: "Look, I figured it would be of interest to you, but I am not super interested in leveraging my relationship with my uncle on your behalf."

Bronislav: "I suppose I can understand that. I appreciate you mentioning the job least."

Ivy: "Yeah, sure."

    You decide not to push your luck, especially since you would hate for her to feel like you are overstepping when she is already being so generous.

    Ivy smiles, as though a lightbulb went off in her head.

    Ivy: "Actually, I might be able to mention you to my uncle to help you get the position."

    Bronislav: "You'd do that?"

    Ivy: "Yeah, of course, as long as I actually remember to."

    Bronislav: "Thank you so much Ivy! I really appreciate it."

    Ivy: "Mhm." 
->ShiftToJensen

=DontAskNeutral

You decide not to push you luck, especially since you don't want to come off as ungrateful.

Bronislav: "Now I have something to look into while I wait for this"
    
Ivy: "Actually, I could probably mention you to my uncle to help with your application."

Bronislav: "Wait, really?"

Ivy: "Yeah I could definitely do that. Well, as long as I remember to." 

Bronislav: "I mean...anything you feel comfortable doing I would definitely be grateful for." 

    Ivy: "Okay..." 

->ShiftToJensen

=DontAskBad

You decide not to push your luck, especially since you and Ivy are not the closest.

Bronislav: "I definitely now have something to look into while I wait for IRB approval." 

Ivy nods.

Bronislav: "But...anything that would help me get the position would be super helpful." 

    Ivy: "Ok..." 

    ->ShiftToJensen

She starts to absent mindedly twist her hair, as she appears to be lost in thought. Her face shifts to a look of concern. It definitely looks like something else is bothering her.

    Ivy stops and looks towards you, a bit surprised by your question.

    Ivy: "Yeah, I'm fine. I guess I am just a bit worried about Jensen."

    *["What's going on with him?"]
        ->WhatsUpWithHim


=== WhatsUpWithHim ===

Bronislav: "What's going on with him?"

Ivy: "He's been really stressed. He's such a hard worker, but he's always worried about not doing enough. It's certainly not helping his anxiousness about getting into the program."

Ivy: "Well, I know Jensen is looking to get on a research paper to help his chances. He thinks that having authorship on something, would really help make an impression."

Ivy: "Maybe you're right," 

Ivy: "The last time he talked he seemed pretty hellbent on getting on a research paper. I'm just not sure how he's going to do it going forward."

=== HeShouldBeWorried ===

Bronislav: "Jensen should be worried. If he isn't on top of his game, he simply won't get in."

Ivy shoots you a look of annoyance.

Ivy: "Yeah I think he's painfully aware of that, which is why he has been so stressed. He keeps bringing up that he needs to get on a research paper to solidify his chances, and I'm not sure how he's going to do it."

The only thing Jensen did to participant on this paper was give that piece of feedback the other day. Is that enough to consider authorship?

You can't remember any other work he contributed, but he did feedback he gave at your presentation. Maybe that's enough to consider him an author?
