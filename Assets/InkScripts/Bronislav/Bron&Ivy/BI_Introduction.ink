{ShowCharacter("Ivy", "left", "")}

You decide to catch up with one of your department's professors, Ivy. She sits down across the table from you, setting down her coffee and smiling.

Ivy: "Hey Bronislav. Good to see you again." {ShowCharacter("Ivy", "left", "")}

*["Nice to see you too, Ivy. How have you been?"]

Hearing this she smiles brightly.

Ivy: "That's great to hear. Did you happen to catch his name?"

*["Jensen."]

Bronislav: "His name was Jensen."

Ivy: "Oh how funny! That's my nephew! He's been having some problems transfering from his masters to a Ph.D program. Being on this paper would be great for him."

Bronislav: "Getting into this program wasn't easy for me either, especially being an international student and all, so I see a bit of myself in him. I'll keep him in mind."

Ivy, while very cheerful about the good news, is also confused.

Ivy: "Do you have some reservations about Jensen?"

==BradExpositionLoop==
You recall hearing a common rumor in the lab of him being "shady" and "off". 
{talkedWithBradAboutJensen: You recall Brad being one of those people adding to the rumor, but who's to say this is really a "rumor"} 
{not talkedWithBradAboutJensen: You're not sure why, or who is spreading this information.}

=== IvySpite ===
Bronislav: "I did also talk with Brad after my presentation, and he felt a bit put off by Jensen."

Ivy's cheerfulness turns to annoyance.

Ivy: "Well Bronislav, I can assure you that there is nothing 'off' about Jensen. He's a good kid, so at least keep him in mind." 

Bronislav: "You seem upset, is everything ok?" 

Ivy: "Everything's fine. I just feel bad for Jensen, it's not right that people are talking bad about him behind his back." 

Bronislav: "No I get it." 

Ivy: "Well I should go for my meeting. Bye." 

Bronislav: "Oh, ok. Bye." 

She leaves the table quickly after saying this.

Bronislav: "As much as I wish I could help right now, I'm really excited about being able to do this research and I really want to keep my options open. I am really hoping writing this will help me with my job prospects and my visa, especially since I am an international student."

She takes a long sip of her drink.

Bronislav: "No, not yet."

Ivy stirs her coffee.

Ivy: "Well, I thought I saw you talking to my nephew Jensen. He is having alot of trouble transferring from his masters into a Ph.D program. Getting on such a big paper would certainly help him."

Ivy: "I can respect that." 

She looks down at her watch.

Ivy: "Oh! I actually need to go to a meeting. Thanks for organizing this Bronislav, hope to hear from you again soon."

Bronislav: "Ok! See you later!" 

She waves goodbye and leaves.
