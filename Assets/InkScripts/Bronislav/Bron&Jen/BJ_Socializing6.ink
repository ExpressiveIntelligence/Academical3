=== AreYouDoingOkay ===

Bronislav: "Hey Jensen, are you doing ok?"

He sighs.

Jensen: "Not really no. Ever since Ned removed me from the lab meetings, all of my applications have gone about how I suspected them to. I appreciate your effort to help me though Bronislav, I really do."

*["I hope things get better." #>> ChangeOpinion Jensen Bronislav ++]

Bronislav: "Sorry with how everything turned out Jensen. I hope things get better for you, and you keep putting in work."

You reach out your hand, and he shakes it firmly.

Jensen: "I hope the same for you, Bronislav, I'll see you when I see you."

=== SeeYouLater ===
Bronislav: "I'll see you later Jensen, whenever that is."

Jensen chuckles a bit.

Jensen: "Yeah, whenever that is."

You walk out of the cafe, waving goodbye and Jensen waves back.

=== CantBlameThem ===
Bronislav: "I can't say I blame them Jensen. Sorry, but, that's life. Hopefully you learn from this."

Jensen looks confused.

Jensen: "I- what? Hopefully I..."

He looks heartbroken.

Jensen: "Yeah, thanks Bronislav..." 

He takes his coffee and leaves begrudgingly.

=== HowAreYou ===
Bronislav: "How are you doing Jensen?"

Jensen: "I'm not doing the best Bronislav. My application is getting denied everywhere even with the paper. It really, really sucks."

=== CanWeTalk ===
Bronislav: "Hey Jensen, can we talk?"

Jensen scoffs.

Jensen: "There isn't much to talk about Bronislav. My application is getting me nowhere ever since Ned removed me from the lab meetings, and I'm just really frustrated."

*["I'll leave you alone."]
->LeaveYouAlone

*["I can't blame them." #>> ChangeOpinion Jensen Bronislav --]

=== LeaveYouAlone ===
Bronislav: "I'll just leave you alone then. Hope you have a good rest of your day."

Jensen: "Right. Thanks, you too Bronislav..."

{HideCharacter("Jensen")}

->DONE

=== WeShouldHaveExpected ===
Bronislav: "We really should have expected this Jensen. I should've trusted my intuition to stay away from this."

Jensen: "Maybe we both should have Bronislav."

He takes his coffee.

Jensen: "Not like we can change it now, my application is getting declined everywhere anyway. I just need to take a break I think."

He walks out of the cafe without another word, or wave.

You walk around and see Jensen typing away at his laptop.

He looks up and notices you as well, waving at you.

*["What are you up to?"]
->WhatAreYouUpTo

*["Now you want to put in the work." #>> ChangeOpinion Jensen Bronislav --]
->NowYouPutInTheWork

=== WhatAreYouUpTo ===
Bronislav: "Hey Jensen, what are you up to?"

Jensen: "Well I've been doing some coursework and I've been talking some more with Ivy. Nothing bad, just about getting more experience so I could actually get on a paper on my own merit."

*["That's great to hear!"]
->ThatsGreat

*["Now you want to put in the work." #>> ChangeOpinion Jensen Bronislav --]
->NowYouPutInTheWork

=== ThatsGreat ===
Bronislav: "Wow! That's great to hear Jensen, determination is a good quality to have. I'm sure you'll find something, if not work on your own paper."

He seems surprised, and happy to hear you say this.

Jensen: "Really Bronislav? You think so? Well, I'd have to thank you for giving me the determination to work harder."

He takes a sip of some coffee.

Jennsen: "Alright, while I'd love to talk more I do need to finish this work for class, so I'll see you later Bronislav."

{HideCharacter("Jensen")}

->DONE

=== NowYouPutInTheWork ===
You laugh a bit at him saying this.

Bronislav: "Oh, so now you want to put in the work Jensen?"

He shuffles in his seat, and is upset to hear you say this.

Jensen: "I mean I've got to at some point right Bronislav? How else can I impress someone as prestigious as yourself."

He says prestigious in a mocking way.

Jensen: "Well I've got to do my work now, I'll see you later Bronislav."

He waves you goodbye before you can get another word out.
