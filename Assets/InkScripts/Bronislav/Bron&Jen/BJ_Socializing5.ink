Jensen gives you a little round of applause.

Jensen: "Well, congratulations, Bronislav!"

Jensen: "I'm really glad things have worked our for all of us."

    //       be at a conference? Do we leave campus?

    Jensen: "What's the name of the guy you were talking with at the conference today? The one I see you hang out with alot?"
