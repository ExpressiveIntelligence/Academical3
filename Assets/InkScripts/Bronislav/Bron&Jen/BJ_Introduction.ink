You nervously approach the podium. The room has filled up with what seems like the entire department - Professors, undergrads, grads, admins.

You go to the front of the room and speak for about 45 minutes. It starts off a little shaky, but you quickly get into the flow and feel confident by the end.

Your peers seemed to enjoy your work. A few tough questions, but nothing you couldn't handle. It's a major relief after so many months of hard research and writing.

Afterward, while packing up your laptop, a line forms of people in the department to give their congratulations.

Hendricks: "Congratulations Bronislav! That was great - I'm so lucky to have such a great advisee!"

Ivy: "Such an impressive presentation. The department could use more of this! My nephew-"
Ivy: "...Ahem, oops! I meant to say undergrad mentee. Sorry about that! Anyways, they wanted to talk to you - keep an ear out!"

The room clears out. A final person, likely an undergrad, approaches you nervously.

Jensen: "Bronislav, right? Nice to meet you. I'm Jensen." {ShowCharacter("Jensen", "left", "")}

He extends his hand for you to shake.

*[Shake his hand.] Bronislav: "Nice to meet you too, Jensen."

Jensen: "I just wanted to talk to you about your presentation and some feedback I had for it."

He pulls out a small notebook.

*["Oh, fantastic."] You reluctantly pull out your own notebook.

Jensen: "I liked how you presented your information for the first half, but I became really confused about halfway through."

Jensen: "I also thought that you could have presented your evidence better, and had a stronger conclusion."
