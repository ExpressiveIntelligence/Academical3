While walking through the library searching for a quiet place to work, you notice a department adviser, Ned, looking through the shelves.

Bronislav: "Good afternoon Professor!"

Ned: "Oh hello there Bronislav, good to see you! How have you been?""

*["I've been pretty good"]
    Bronislav: "I've been doing pretty good, just been working on classes and my research paper."
    
    Ned: "Thats good to hear, glad things are going well."
    
    Bronislav: "How about you how is everything going?"
    
    Ned: "Busy, but well, Brad is currently waiting on IRB approval."

== BNS1_ThatsExciting ==
Bronislav: "That's exciting news, my study is almost ready for review!"

Ned: "That's nice! Seems like you're keeping busy too. I know Brad can be a little impatient, but it usually takes a while for IRB approval to go through."

Bronislav: "Yeah that makes sense."

Ned: "But it should come through pretty soon, he just needs to hold out a little longer."
